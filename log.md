# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started my REACT Journey with a few challenges on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/).

**Thoughts:** Since I have gotten better with Javascript I have been looking to learn REACT and this challenge has been a code way to get me motivated to get started. So far the concepts of JSX and components seem pretty straightforward. I look forward to finishing this Code Camp module so I can start a project.

### Day 1: April 26, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) and then did an extra hour of tutorials on udemy. 

**Thoughts:** About half way through the freecodecamp learning module now. Props were a little confusing at first but I seem to have a bit of a handle on them. Started learning States before I had to change tasks and start another project. I do have an idea of a project I want to tackle when I get a better grasp of the basics.
