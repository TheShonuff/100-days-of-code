# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started my REACT Journey with a few challenges on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/).

**Thoughts:** Since I have gotten better with Javascript I have been looking to learn REACT and this challenge has been a code way to get me motivated to get started. So far the concepts of JSX and components seem pretty straightforward. I look forward to finishing this Code Camp module so I can start a project.

### Day 1: April 26, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) and then did an extra hour of tutorials on udemy. 

**Thoughts:** About half way through the freecodecamp learning module now. Props were a little confusing at first but I seem to have a bit of a handle on them. Started learning States before I had to change tasks and start another project. I do have an idea of a project I want to tackle when I get a better grasp of the basics.

### Day 2: April 27, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Mocked my project in Figma to get an idea of what the end result may look like. Discovered CodeWars today and spend a little too much time on one of the problems. Went through a couple of FreeCodeCamp modules and started a code along Pokdex project on uDemy. 

**Thoughts:** Discovered CodeWars through twitter today. The problems seem to be a little more beginner friendly compared to LeetCode. Worked through 3 problems and spent a lot of time on the binary to number problem. When I solved the problem I discovered it was solved in one line with parseInt. Which is a way more elegant solution then what I wrote. 

Finished an online connect form using nodemailer and multiparty for a website I'm making for a photographer friend. Struggled getting the modal to accept subject line specific to the item clicked. Solved the problem using subject.value =  rather than subject.textContent.
