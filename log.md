# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Started my REACT Journey with a few challenges on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/).

**Thoughts:** Since I have gotten better with Javascript I have been looking to learn REACT and this challenge has been a code way to get me motivated to get started. So far the concepts of JSX and components seem pretty straightforward. I look forward to finishing this Code Camp module so I can start a project.

### Day 1: April 26, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Continued with[Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/) and then did an extra hour of tutorials on udemy. 

**Thoughts:** About half way through the freecodecamp learning module now. Props were a little confusing at first but I seem to have a bit of a handle on them. Started learning States before I had to change tasks and start another project. I do have an idea of a project I want to tackle when I get a better grasp of the basics.

### Day 2: April 27, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Mocked my project in Figma to get an idea of what the end result may look like. Discovered CodeWars today and spend a little too much time on one of the problems. Went through a couple of FreeCodeCamp modules and started a code along Pokdex project on uDemy. 

**Thoughts:** Discovered CodeWars through twitter today. The problems seem to be a little more beginner friendly compared to LeetCode. Worked through 3 problems and spent a lot of time on the binary to number problem. When I solved the problem I discovered it was solved in one line with parseInt. Which is a way more elegant solution then what I wrote. 

Finished an online connect form using nodemailer and multiparty for a website I'm making for a photographer friend. Struggled getting the modal to accept subject line specific to the item clicked. Solved the problem using subject.value =  rather than subject.textContent.

### Day 3: April 28, 2022 

**Today's Progress**: Not much on the javascript/react progress today. Been working on a photopgraphy website and got caught up on getting the portfolio page working. I was able to review notes on REACT components and props. I performed a couple of review exercises at the end of chapter 4 in Eloquent JS book.

**Thoughts:** Working on a client webpage and found a responsive plugin called masonry. I was able to install the plugin but was unable to get the application working correctly through node. I need a better understanding of importing/exporting modules. I found an application that can "roll-up" you're javascripts on deployment so they all work but I didn't understand the concepts fully. 

I spent too much time trying to get masonry-layout working today. I did end up achieving a product that is functional but outside what I originally set out to do. I have the script for masonry loading into a script tag on the page and calibrated bootstrap to handle the layout adjustments. After this project I probably will never use bootstrap or some sort of framework for CSS ever again.

### Day 4: April 29, 2022

**Today's Progress**: It's Friday but my Monday at work. Today I'm tired and only did the minimum 1 hour. I worked through the final bit of exercises of chapter 4 in Eloquent JS and ran a few CodeWars.

**Thoughts** It seems to there is so much too memorize and remember when solving some of these code war problems. I often make silly mistakes in my function writing which leads to extra time debugging. 

### Day 5: April 30, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Busy day at work today but still managed to log almost 3 hours of computer time. A good chunk of my time was spent trying to figure out how I broke npm. I *was* using npm with [SUDO](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally) and finally made the change to get off of that. At first nothing was working in my terminal which was fixed after closing my terminal session. Then I need to point my shell to the new path. 

After that headache I was able to deply a site I was working on to start developing an instagram basic view but realzed how broken the site is still so I'm gonna go back and start going through the bugs tomorrow.

I then logged 1 hour on uDemy finishing a REACT code along. Then I started working through a Mongo/Express demonstration. 

**Thoughts** Need to start practicing this tutorials more. I'm starting to get a sense the information is not really sticking well. 

### Day 6: May 1, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Did the minimum amount of work required today. Between a busy day and work and an early day tomorrow I decided to take a semi-rest day. I discovered notion and began importing all my notes over for easier access. I then did a couple of codewars problems and looked into Bundlers.

**Thoughts**: I am having trouble choosing a javascript bundler. There are a few options with Webpack, Rollup and Parcel being the most popular choices. However they all seem to take different approaches. Based on the summary at [bundler report](bundlers.tooling.report) I might be choosing between Parcel or Webpack. I need to grok what's happening in the package.json scripts section to unlock how these work. 

### Day 7: May 2, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Wrote my final lab for ELE 181 in C++ today. Was a relatively easy assignment that combined all the lessons into one lab. After learning Python and Javascript this was a very easy lab to perform. I then moved on to learning more about React state and props. Finished a couple of FreedCodeCamp modules.

**Thoughts**: Feeling more confident in understanding state and props. I need to go back and understand further callbacks and arrow functions. I seem to shy away from using them probably because I don't fully grok the callback.
