# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 25, 2022 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Started my REACT Journey with a few challenges on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/).

**Thoughts:** Since I have gotten better with Javascript I have been looking to learn REACT and this challenge has been a code way to get me motivated to get started. So far the concepts of JSX and components seem pretty straightforward. I look forward to finishing this Code Camp module so I can start a project.
